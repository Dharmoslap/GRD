Singular-Grid
=============

Lightweight Mobile-first responsive CSS grid. 


Made for everyone who is convinced, that mobile web should have dedicated layout and should't be mixed with bloated dektop markup and resources. 



Ok, responsive webdesign is great, but itâ€™s not a silver bullet. Moreover how does it feel if someone shrink your fully responzive web on 11' laptop? Shouldn't be user should be free to resize browser window and still get the same full-featured destop layout?
