Singular-Grid
=============

Lightweight Mobile-first responsive CSS grid. 


Made in belief, that mobile web should have it's own dedicated layout and should't be mixed with bloated dektop markup and resources. 



Ok, responsive webdesign is great, but itâ€™s not a silver bullet. Moreover what happens after user shrink your responzive web on 11' laptop? Tablet version? Shouldn't be user should be free to resize browser window and still get the same desktop layout?
